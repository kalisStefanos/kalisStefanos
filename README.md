## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Stefanos, a CS student from Greece.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Full-Stack project for Uni.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Spring Boot for that same project.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I play football as an amateur for a local team. Football is my passion and I won't stop playing unless my legs tell me to.

#### How I got here:

I got into CS because of game development, as I always wanted to know how things work "behind the scenes" and how I could make my own game scenarios "Come to Life". While CS courses won't actually dive into game development, they provide you with foundamental knowledge about machines and programming and thus you gain some vision on how to approach different subjects of CS, such as game development. In other words, its making the learning curve easier.
  Some may wonder why choose CS degree instead of going to a Game Development Univercity. Well... I really wanted to go through all the courses the degree was offering, in case I found something that I would enjoy putting my hands on. I discovered that Developing Software could be my thing. So, here i am know, working on projects, learning technologies, gaining experience day by day. I just wish the days were longer so that i could fit some game dev hours too.
